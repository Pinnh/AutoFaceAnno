# AutoFaceAnno

Automatic face annotate by MTCNN(Pytorch).

Annotations are saved as XML files in PASCAL VOC format, the format used by ImageNet.

You can use https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg to modify the face rects and resave annotations.

Thanks for the https://github.com/TropComplique/mtcnn-pytorch which use to detect faces in this project.
